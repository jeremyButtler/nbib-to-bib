AB  - BACKGROUND: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a member of the Flaviviridae 
      family, Flavivirus genus, which includes several important human pathogens. It is 
      responsible for neurological symptoms that may cause permanent disability or 
      death, and, from a medical point of view, is the major arbovirus in 
      Central/Northern Europe and North-Eastern Asia. TBEV tropism is critical for 
      neuropathogenesis, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern 
      the susceptibility of human brain cells to the virus. In this study, we sought to 
      establish and characterize a new in vitro model of TBEV infection in the human 
      brain and to decipher cell type-specific innate immunity and its relation to TBEV 
      tropism and neuropathogenesis. METHOD: Human neuronal/glial cells were 
      differentiated from neural progenitor cells and infected with the TBEV-Hypr 
      strain. Kinetics of infection, cellular tropism, and cellular responses, 
      including innate immune responses, were characterized by measuring viral genome 
      and viral titer, performing immunofluorescence, enumerating the different 
      cellular types, and determining their rate of infection and by performing PCR 
      array and qRT-PCR. The specific response of neurons and astrocytes was analyzed 
      using the same approaches after enrichment of the neuronal/glial cultures for 
      each cellular subtype. RESULTS: We showed that infection of human neuronal/glial 
      cells mimicked three major hallmarks of TBEV infection in the human brain, 
      namely, preferential neuronal tropism, neuronal death, and astrogliosis. We 
      further showed that these cells conserved their capacity to mount an antiviral 
      response against TBEV. TBEV-infected neuronal/glial cells, therefore, represented 
      a highly relevant pathological model. By enriching the cultures for either 
      neurons or astrocytes, we further demonstrated qualitative and quantitative 
      differential innate immune responses in the two cell types that correlated with 
      their particular susceptibility to TBEV. CONCLUSION: Our results thus reveal that 
      cell type-specific innate immunity is likely to contribute to shaping TBEV 
      tropism for human brain cells. They describe a new in vitro model for in-depth 
      study of TBEV-induced neuropathogenesis and improve our understanding of the 
      mechanisms by which neurotropic viruses target and damage human brain cells.

TI  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) prevalence in field-collected ticks (Ixodes 
      ricinus) and phylogenetic, structural and virulence analysis in a TBE high-risk 
      endemic area in southwestern Germany.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most common viral CNS infection 
      with incidences much higher than all other virus infections together in many risk 
      areas of central and eastern Europe. The Odenwald Hill region (OWH) in 
      southwestern Germany is classified as a TBE risk region and frequent case numbers 
      but also more severe infections have been reported within the past decade. The 
      objective of the present study was to survey the prevalence of tick-borne 
      encephalitis virus (TBEV) in Ixodes ricinus and to associate TBEV genetic 
      findings with TBE infections in the OWH. METHODS: Ticks were collected by the 
      flagging methods supported by a crowdsourcing project implementing the interested 
      public as collectors to cover completely and collect randomly a 3532 km(2) area 
      of the OWH TBE risk region. Prevalence of TBEV in I. ricinus was analysed by 
      reversed transcription quantitative real-time PCR. Phylogeographic analysis was 
      performed to classify OWH TBEV isolates within a European network of known TBEV 
      strains. Mutational sequence analysis including 3D modelling of envelope protein 
      pE was performed and based on a clinical database, a spatial association of TBE 
      case frequency and severity was undertaken. RESULTS: Using the crowd sourcing 
      approach we could analyse a total of 17,893 ticks. The prevalence of TBEV in I. 
      ricinus in the OWH varied, depending on analysed districts from 0.12% to 0% (mean 
      0.04%). Calculated minimum infection rate (MIR) was one decimal power higher. All 
      TBEV isolates belonged to the European subtype. Sequence analysis revealed a 
      discontinuous segregation pattern of OWH isolates with two putative different 
      lineages and a spatial association of two isolates with increased TBE case 
      numbers as well as exceptional severe to fatal infection courses. CONCLUSIONS: 
      TBEV prevalence within the OWH risk regions is comparatively low which is 
      probably due to our methodological approach and may more likely reflect 
      prevalence of natural TBEV foci. As for other European regions, TBEV genetics 
      show a discontinuous phylogeny indicating among others an association with bird 
      migration. Mutations within the pE gene are associated with more frequent, severe 
      and fatal TBE infections in the OWH risk region.
