  Abstract={
    BACKGROUND: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a
    member of the Flaviviridae family, Flavivirus genus,
    which includes several important human pathogens. It
    is responsible for neurological symptoms that may
    cause permanent disability or death, and, from a
    medical point of view, is the major arbovirus in
    Central/Northern Europe and North-Eastern Asia. TBEV
    tropism is critical for neuropathogenesis, yet little
    is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern
    the susceptibility of human brain cells to the virus.
    In this study, we sought to establish and
    characterize a new in vitro model of TBEV infection
    in the human brain and to decipher cell type-specific
    innate immunity and its relation to TBEV tropism and
    neuropathogenesis. METHOD: Human neuronal/glial cells
    were differentiated from neural progenitor cells and
    infected with the TBEV-Hypr strain. Kinetics of
    infection, cellular tropism, and cellular responses,
    including innate immune responses, were characterized
    by measuring viral genome and viral titer, performing
    immunofluorescence, enumerating the different
    cellular types, and determining their rate of
    infection and by performing PCR array and qRT-PCR.
    The specific response of neurons and astrocytes was
    analyzed using the same approaches after enrichment
    of the neuronal/glial cultures for each cellular
    subtype. RESULTS: We showed that infection of human
    neuronal/glial cells mimicked three major hallmarks
    of TBEV infection in the human brain, namely,
    preferential neuronal tropism, neuronal death, and
    astrogliosis. We further showed that these cells
    conserved their capacity to mount an antiviral
    response against TBEV. TBEV-infected neuronal/glial
    cells, therefore, represented a highly relevant
    pathological model. By enriching the cultures for
    either neurons or astrocytes, we further demonstrated
    qualitative and quantitative differential innate
    immune responses in the two cell types that
    correlated with their particular susceptibility to
    TBEV. CONCLUSION: Our results thus reveal that cell
    type-specific innate immunity is likely to contribute
    to shaping TBEV tropism for human brain cells. They
    describe a new in vitro model for in-depth study of
    TBEV-induced neuropathogenesis and improve our
    understanding of the mechanisms by which neurotropic
    viruses target and damage human brain cells.

  Abstract={
    BACKGROUND: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most
    common viral CNS infection with incidences much
    higher than all other virus infections together in
    many risk areas of central and eastern Europe. The
    Odenwald Hill region (OWH) in southwestern Germany is
    classified as a TBE risk region and frequent case
    numbers but also more severe infections have been
    reported within the past decade. The objective of the
    present study was to survey the prevalence of
    tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in Ixodes
    ricinus and to associate TBEV genetic findings with
    TBE infections in the OWH. METHODS: Ticks were
    collected by the flagging methods supported by a
    crowdsourcing project implementing the interested
    public as collectors to cover completely and collect
    randomly a 3532 km(2) area of the OWH TBE risk
    region. Prevalence of TBEV in I. ricinus was analysed
    by reversed transcription quantitative real-time PCR.
    Phylogeographic analysis was performed to classify
    OWH TBEV isolates within a European network of known
    TBEV strains. Mutational sequence analysis including
    3D modelling of envelope protein pE was performed and
    based on a clinical database, a spatial association
    of TBE case frequency and severity was undertaken.
    RESULTS: Using the crowd sourcing approach we could
    analyse a total of 17,893 ticks. The prevalence of
    TBEV in I. ricinus in the OWH varied, depending on
    analysed districts from 0.12% to 0% (mean 0.04%).
    Calculated minimum infection rate (MIR) was one
    decimal power higher. All TBEV isolates belonged to
    the European subtype. Sequence analysis revealed a
    discontinuous segregation pattern of OWH isolates
    with two putative different lineages and a spatial
    association of two isolates with increased TBE case
    numbers as well as exceptional severe to fatal
    infection courses. CONCLUSIONS: TBEV prevalence
    within the OWH risk regions is comparatively low
    which is probably due to our methodological approach
    and may more likely reflect prevalence of natural
    TBEV foci. As for other European regions, TBEV
    genetics show a discontinuous phylogeny indicating
    among others an association with bird migration.
    Mutations within the pE gene are associated with more
    frequent, severe and fatal TBE infections in the OWH
    risk region.
